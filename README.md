# Employee-Management-System

## Description

## Your Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, so I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Installation

To run this app, you must download the repo and run npm install to be able to install the npm package dependencies in the package.json. You will also need to use MySQL and finally run the employee management system by typing node server.js
<br />
- npm install --save mysql2
- npm install inquirer
- npm install console.table --save
* mysql -u root -p
* source schema.sql
* source seeds.sql
